I am a third-year graduate student at the [School of Information Science and Engineering](https://computer.haut.edu.cn/),  [Henan University of Technology](https://www.haut.edu.cn/). My research focuses on computer vision, multi-task learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal domains. 

I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Wei Wei](https://cs.haut.edu.cn/info/1541/5794.htm). Although my research interests don't fully align with his primary focus, he has generously provided me with ample academic freedom and unwavering encouragement.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a developer in the internet industry, specializing in Java backend development and cloud computing.

In fact, even earlier in my career, I was a civil engineer. I suppose it was the emergence of AlphaGo that solidified my determination to study computer science🤣.

In summary, if you are looking for a collaborator with a diverse background in computer science and solid engineering skills, let's talk.

Here is my [CV-cn](../assets/简历-计算机科学与技术-刘一聪.pdf).
